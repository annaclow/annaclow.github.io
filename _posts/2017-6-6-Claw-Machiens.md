title: Claw Machines and other bits

This [dailymail (booo) article](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4375662/The-king-claw-machines-shares-secrets-winning.html) made me think about arcade games, specifically 'merchandisers', and their place in gaming historically and culturally. They are mostly available in public spaces and so lend themselves to subversion.

There's all sorts of arcade machine mods and tutorials on builds, and I think this way I could create something specifically for a public space.

[Push Me Pull You](http://pmpygame.com/) is a game for **2-4 Players** that encorporates competition, funny visuals and skill. The objective is relatively simple, get the ball to one place using your connected worm body.
