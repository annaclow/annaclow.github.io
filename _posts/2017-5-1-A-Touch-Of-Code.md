title: A Touch of Code, and other research
---

[A Touch of Code](http://shop.gestalten.com/a-touch-of-code.html) features varied uses of the physical controller, including education, sound production & design products.

**Isach Betran**'s piece [Pas A Pas](http://www.pasapas-project.com/) allows children to use different physical shapes to create the individual frames for a stop motion animation. The children learn about how animation works per frame which builds on and uses their understanding of maths, physics and computing. The setup is beautifully designed, like a danish interactive overheard projector. There's also a platform set up for sharing the animations and generally it's incredible. This isn't really a controller as much as it is a tool, but why can't there be both.

**Yuri Suzuki**'s work [Colour Chaser](http://yurisuzuki.com/archive/works/colour-chaser/) features a small vehicle which translates the coloured pen into sounds. The controller comes from both the drawings, which can be created again and again, and the chaser allowing the user to influence the sound produced.

**Yuri Suzuki**'s more recent work is just as incredible including a bespoke circuit board you can assemble yourself called [Denki Puzzle](http://yurisuzuki.com/archive/works/denki-puzzle/) allowing users to use simple parts to create a more complex technology and this [drum machine](http://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2015/04/how-jeff-mills-built-a-ufo-drum-machine) he built for Jeff Mills!

**Anders Hojmose and Sebastian Ronde Thiekles** work [Daily Stack](http://everyoneelse.net/projects/daily-stack/) allowed users to become aware of their time management and daily tasks through physically stacking represntations of daily activites. The simplicity of the design makes the objects and the widget unobtrusive to user and almost child like in their simplicity.

**Felix Vorreiter**'s type printing machine is amazing, the exposed circuitry and slashed typography produced looks beautiful and guerilla. Again, this is not really a controller for a resulting game as much as it is a tool. The definition of a tool is 'A device or implement, especially one held in the hand, used to carry out a particular function.' and often in games you control a virtual tool with a controller i.e a sword, fishing rod, gun etc.
