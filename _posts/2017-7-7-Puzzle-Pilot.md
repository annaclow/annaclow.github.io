[Trappy Mine](https://roguenoodle.itch.io/trappy-mine) is a game I found, recommded for puzzle platformer, from [itch.io](https://itch.io/) which is a great place to find indie games, that tend to be shorter than commercial games. I played this with a friend and will be doing further pilot testing before creating the full controller.

So many steam games weren't working with my controller, and I didn't want to create the inputs for each trigger/button/joystick that comes with the Steam controller.

Need to make sure the buttons are easily translatable and people know what each one does, verbal communication is very much key.

Looking more into [Exertion Games](http://exertiongameslab.org/projects/unojoy) who brought out UnoJoy with the hope that people could easily create their own novel controllers
