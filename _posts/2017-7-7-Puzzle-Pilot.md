Pilot Testing:
1. Dialogue will be continuous
2. Elements of Leadership (could be influenced by me playing)
3. Time Based element forces people to learn quickly and constantly communicate --> [Trappy Mine](https://roguenoodle.itch.io/trappy-mine) has a rising platform that encourages quick actions 
4. People need to understand game inputs before hand although lack of also leeds to a fun period of people finding their 'feet'
5. Should make an introductory Unity splash page that shows the user the controls

[Trappy Mine](https://roguenoodle.itch.io/trappy-mine) is a game I found, recommded for puzzle platformer, from [itch.io](https://itch.io/) which is a great place to find indie games, that tend to be shorter than commercial games. I played this with a friend and will be doing further pilot testing before creating the full controller.

Various games weren't working with my controller as it does not fit the requirements of a Steam controller i.e L/R trigger/two gamepads/joystick

Need to make sure the buttons are easily translatable and people know what each one does, verbal communication is very much key.

Looking more into [Exertion Games](http://exertiongameslab.org/projects/unojoy) who brought out UnoJoy with the hope that people could easily create their own novel controllers.
