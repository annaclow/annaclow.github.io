Now Play This was full of incredible controllers and it has encouraged me to look further into the subversive and immersive nature of alternate controllers.

The work of Katie Marshall and Alex Johansson is so incredible. It works beutifully as a two player game as each player is totally reliant on the other for a) information and b)action. The syringe controller was very satisfying to use and the the body was CNC'd + painted incredibly. The combination of this controller and body, the action of healing the body with the syringe, was very immersive and definintely one of the best controllers I saw that day.

I would like to create a co-op game, where **communication** is necessary to win and a big part of the excitement and fun. It also creates a new dialogue between two, in my case, strangers.

Another piece that really struck a creative chord in me was the work of Jenny Jiao Hsia. Her makeup madness was inspired by a 10 second brief and she created this wonderful game where you have 10 seconds to do the protagonist's makeup, which she links to having to rush to get ready in the morning. The game was well adapted to the arcade controller as well as online. This arcade controller allowed it to be more of an attraction, and maybe even more submersive. Her work raises questions about, tackles issues concerning, the every day struggles women face and playing a non-fighting, non-sci-fi game in such a 'historic' gaming format was refreshing.

In an [interview](http://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2016/december/jenny-jiao-hsia-on-video-game-design.html)
 with NYU about her working she describes the repetitive actions of Animal Crossing as being similar to knitting. You fish, forrage, catch bugs and garden virtually and I felt an incredible sense of calm when playing. 

_" “Games are systems that we can use to make ourselves feel certain things, and traditional games have this way of making us feel empowered,” she says. “But it’s cool to see that now we can totally do the opposite with the same system and subvert it. There’s a lot to explore in that realm.” "_
