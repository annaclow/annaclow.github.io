title: LEDs not working with Controller Mode
---

I wanted to turn on LEDs when the user pressed the button but unfortunately, the game registers confuses these pins and button controls. It results in the game interpreting them as button inputs and generally messing up the controls. The circuit works perfectly when acting as an arduino however, when I use the uno as a controller it registers the leds as other control inputs.

```java
int LEDpins[] = {10,11,12,A0,A1,A2,A3,A4};

//down in loop
 for(int i = 2; i <=9;i++){
   if(digitalRead(i)==LOW){ //if button is pressed
    digitalWrite(LEDpins[i-2], HIGH); //light LED above physical button
      } else {
       digitalWrite(LEDpins[i-2], LOW); //turn of LED
      }
```
