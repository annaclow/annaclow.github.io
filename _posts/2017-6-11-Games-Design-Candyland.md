title: Games, Design and Play and Looking critically at Candyland
---
Games, Design and Play outlines the fundamental elements of play experience:

1. Actions
2. Rules
3. Goals
4. Objects
5. Playspace
6. Players

_Colleen Macklin and John Sharp. Games, Design and Play: A Detailed Approach to Iterative Game Design. Boston: Addison-Wesley, 2016_


Candyland:
1. Move character along the path of the board, Pick up cards 
2. Each player picks up a card each turn, and moves to the next matching coloured square on the path. If a double squared card is picked up then move to the second matching square.
3. To get to the end of the path in less turns than your opponent. The goals of the game also include teaching young children about colour matching, counting and following rules within a game. 
4. The cards dictate the following moves. Special paths bridge squares allowing you to advance further along the board
5. The playspace is the board, which also contains objects (bridges mentioned) that players can use to skip ahead. 
6. Multiplayer game for young children.

‘Space of possibility’ 
_Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman. Rules of Play: Game Design Fundamentals. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT, 2010_

The space of possibility is very focused in Candyland, if there are no errors during the game then the entire game is predetermined, including the winner, through the order of the cards. There are limited actions to the game and the game state is relatively static throughout the game.  

[Curtain](https://dreamfeel.itch.io/curtain):
1. Walk around and along 3D path, select items to learn more, look around space
2. To progress in the game you must explore the space. You cannot click on an item (to create the text) more than once in the current playspace.
3. To move through the space, the stages in time, until the game is completed. The goal really lies in the experience of the game: existing as a (first-person view of) a woman in an abusive relationship. 
4. To learn about the characters relationship through selecting items and reading the text. The shower acts as a bridge between one part of time and another, which advances the game to different future periods of time.
5. Playspace is the game itself.
6. One player. 

The space of possibility is limited in terms of actions however, there is nothing pushing you through the game: you are able to explore the space in the current gamestate for as long as you want. There are 3 major shifts, visually connected by bridging, in the game that bring up a varied version of the playspace.  

Exercises
_Swap one element between two games: a single rule, one action, the goal or the playspace […] Imagine how the play experience would change based on this swap._
Pg 14, Games, Design and Play

Swap the rules of Candyland and Curtain:
Candyland: you click on the coloured path to bring about text information, which informs you, in small pieces, about the current situation of Candyland. The path is no longer binding/ controlled by card movement, you move aimlessly around the board selecting items to bring about more information regarding who you are playing and what world you are playing in.

Curtain: Pick a virtual card with a colour, associate colours with objects in the room and now have a non-linear story line that uses the colour picked to evoke the tone of the current time period. i.e the first part of curtain is mostly red/blue hues suggesting a loneliness and sadness and this is further emphasized when the colours shift to pastel, once out of the abusive relationship.

A blue object could bring up text from a darker period of time where as a yellow object would perhaps bring around text from a later period time, post-relationship. This would shift the linearity of the game and disrupt the playspace hugely, create a timeline that is based upon the order of cards and objects selected. It would be much harder to understand the story and truly experience the claustrophobic and abusive nature of the story.
