title: Redesiging Candyland
---

Candyland is a very simple game that features no skill or elements of chance, apart from how the cards are shuffled. The game is very simple, as it is meant for children, so I wanted to repurpose parts of the game and give the story a different narrative. The storyline follows two characters, the players, as they consume their way through Dreonsorsa (Candyland) after having the curves and bulk from their bodies stripped by the dark overlord.

I wanted to incorporate a body positive metaphor about eating, and move away from the original child like message of candyland. I set the game ina different realm to abstract it further, all the names were generated from [this site](http://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/alien-names.php#.WRNtbLwrKHo)

I wanted to still incorporate the colour matching from the original game, and have the players move around a similar board, but to update a couple of the rules and change the experience and general gameplay. I began writing the narrative, about the players trying to eat their way through the land to regain their former shapes and being shamed whilst doing so, then moved to the specific rules. Through introducing elements of chance, picking up pieces and forfeiting, the game is no longer predictable and (while still requiring no skill) incorporates chance and randomness.

I created the story and game rules as a simple point and click web document [Dreonsorsa](http://doc.gold.ac.uk/~aclow049/game/Dreonsorsa.html). The cards and video of gameplay are to come!
