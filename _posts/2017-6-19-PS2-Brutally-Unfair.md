title: Scaled PS2 Controller 
---
My plan to create a controller that allows many people to play as a single player, and through this explore the benefits of and new experiences found through collaborative play. I initially planned to create a scaled ps2 controller, as it is very familiar to me and generationally makes sense. However, through trying to hack the controller, and moving through the games, I began to realise that for time's sake it didn't really make sense + start up costs means using my computer would be easier.

Here's some collaborative play that uses a single button on a normal xbox controller. I do not want to create an experience like this; although this is very engaging and successfully collaborative in people working against each other, you are not creating a single player and working together towards exactly the same goal, which I believe will create a very different experience of gaming.

I put a lot of thought into which genre of games would make most sense for collaborative play, which hold true for whatever platform I work with. Games that focused on quick, somewhat repetitive, tasks would make most sense in order to keep the many players interested. These included action, action-adventure and simulation games; which usually allow for multiplayer but do not allow for you to play collaboratively as a single player. Which in contrast goes against the genres that MMOs usually fall under i.e in RPG games. For example platformer games would allow for the rules to be easy to follow and the difficulty to increase after being introduced at the beginning, for example the [Super Mario Bros. opening scene](http://auntiepixelante.com/?p=465); simulation games such as SSX, gran turismo etc. allow you to immediately understand the goals of the game, as it translates in real life.


**What knowledgable people have recommended about the project**
The independant variables I've been looking into are:
Which genre of game works best?
How many people works best?

To do some:
Pilot testing
Test it very quickly; agile development process

Project options:
A)
Design a single game + controller

B)
Collaboration; user study; understood 
Design recommendations

Mine will be a combined project; as the controller will be created as will the study + recommendations

Need to begin on user studies!
User studies:
Qualititive study: analysing whether  
Statistics:
Giving poeple preferences, want to repeat it; data collecting is already able to be analysed
