title: Computerspielemuseum & Anna Anthropy
---

I recently visited the Computerspielemuseum and was able to play Giant Joystick (Flanagan, 2006) and PainStation (//////////fur////, 2001)! Both games need to be played in person as they focus on the physical nature of game play, subverting traditional interfaces/ games (atari joystick/ pong) to create a more immersive experience. 

I was nervous, even afraid, to play PainStation way before we actually put our hands down to play. Signing away your right to sue before playing, ensuring that you are 18, and pressing your hand down to begin play already had my heart racing. The initial shock/ whipping/ heat are very mild and produced laughter from the onlooking audience and myself. The extra layer of pressure, physical pressure, forces you to engage seriously with Pong, which is a game of very few rules/ actions.

Mary Flanagan's Giant Joystick played with the conventional interface associated with early arcade games, specifically the 1980 Atari
2600 interface, allowing for the user and a friend to work together with their whole bodies to play games they already knew: redefining the experience expected from 'Pac-Man'.

['Game/Play' Exhibition](http://blog.game-play.org.uk/files/GamePlay_Final.pdf) Christian Paul writes that Giant Joystick 'requires players to collaboratively ‘perform’ their movements in order to engage with the game and thus makes them acknowledge not only the notion of shared space but also the necessity for shared strategies and approaches in order to pursue their goal'. This idea of shared, immediate and physical strategies is very important in an age where collaborative play usually happens through interfaces spread around the world. 

'Rather than treating the joystick as mere access point to the ‘other’ of the virtual world on a screen, the project highlights the joystick’s role in and connection to the physical world and the social nature of play.'

Anna Anthropy

[Lesbian Spider-Queens Of Mars](http://www.adultswim.com/games/web/lesbian-spider-queens-of-mars) is an 8-bit aesthetic flash game about submission/ domination; which follows a similar aesthetic/ game play to Pac Man however, you are the one after the ghosts/slaves. It challenges the nostalgic perception of PacMan to introduce ideas about/ celebration of queer culture.
