1. Telling one another the rules
2. Leadership comes into it, me and one other person being more vocal
3. Switching buttons to distribute the responsibility
4. Screaming as the time runs out, Laughing!
5. Discussing and evaluating the rules between play
6. "Go, Go, Go, Go", "Dont't do that", "Run, Run, Run"

The pilot testing has returned lots of very useful information as to what is interesting about the play; how the rules are understood and implemented
