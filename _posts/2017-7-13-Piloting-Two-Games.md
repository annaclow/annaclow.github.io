After recieving feedback that Trappy Mine was 'quite hard' I decided not to test an RPG game alongside a sports game. [Birdsketball](https://waynetron.itch.io/birdsketball) is a sports game based around the game basketball that I chose as a second genre of game to test whether puzzle platformer games would fit better in a multiplayer/single player situation.

**Birdsketball**
1. Rotate Left
2. Rotate Right
3. Accelerate
4. Fly

**Trappy Mine**
1. Move Left
2. Move Right
3. Drop a bomb
4. Jump 
5. Look Down
6. Mine
7. Mine/ Up
8. Mine/ Down

Pilot Testing:
#2: 2 players, Birdsketball
* 'What am I doing' 'Let's stop a sec' need to ensure that everyone knows what the buttons do
* screaming, laughing, blaming 
* 'Don't press a sec' leadership comes up again; relates to amount of time gaming 
* Less dialogue than in trappy mine

#3: 2 players, Trappy Mine
* Switching buttons after playing; trying to play effectively; 'You do all the movement I'll do the mining and bombs' 
* Telling one another what to do
* Blocks themselves are confusing as to which are dangerous; part of gameplay
* Constant dialogue

#4: 2 players, Birdsketball
* Less dialogue
* Confusion on parts played
* Physics need to be very direct
* Swapping controls

#5: 3 players, Trappy Mine
* Telling people what to do; correlates with time spent gaming
* 2 people have 
* 'Game goes really quickly' 
* Redistributing positions again
